<h1>Chat Server</h1>
<p>This chat server project is something I have been working on for quite some time. I have quite a big goal for it and I am always updating it. It is currently in a working state and supports Commands, easy intergration and much more. I plan on adding SSL / TLS, Encryption, and maybe even just flat out making an API in the future as well as Data Base support and much more. I've tried and keep it as simple as I can while also having good performance and easy to read code.</p>
